## Overall

- Comment XSLs, XSDs, Pages, Wizards

- check for program availabilities

- Use client Proxy in raysession
    => set the save level of each application in the ray-proxy xml files (created by raysession.sh snippets).
  
- Schema creation :
  More contraint checks on dependencies and types
  #in progress

- document the examples

- handle QListWidget (with checkbox / radio) type and QTableWidget ?

- check that all required programs are available on the system (check version ?) depending on the section declared in the conf file or datamodel.json. 

- Check that variables are not using reserved variable names and that they are uniq in the xml file.
