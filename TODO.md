# TODO

## Wizards

add application like:
  Mumble
  Audacity
  Reaper

Start Jamulus server with recording option

Testing ...

simple_example does not work:

- jack_capture does not load ...

- alsaplayer cannot be found Catia 
    
    simple_example doesn't work with Catia because the jackclientname cannot be set and the default is alsaplayer-ID 
    and we don't know the ID  ... nor we know the pid of the jack client name from jack lib.

## Overall

- Comment XSLs, XSDs, Pages, Wizards
  
- Schema creation :
  More contraint checks on dependencies and types
  #in progress

- document the examples

- handle QListWidget (with checkbox / radio) type and QTableWidget ?

- Check that variables are not using reserved variable names and that they are uniq in the xml file.
